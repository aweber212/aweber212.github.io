		<h3>The Cast</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>A young <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong> plays the perfect James Bond on screen, an agent with an edge, deadly aim with his Walther PPK, but who can also charm his way out of (or into) any situation</li>
		<li><strong>Izabella Scorupco</strong> plays the Bond girl. In <em>Goldeneye</em>, Scorupco's character, Natalya Simonova, is an integral part to the plot, unlike some earlier movies where the Bond girl is just a prop.</li>
		<li>006 agent Alec Trevelyan, played by <strong>Sean Bean</strong> plays a realistic Bond villian, hellbent on getting revenge on those he feel betrayed him</li>
		<li><em>Goldeneye</em> is also unique in that there exists a second Bond girl, a villan! Xenia Onatopp, played by <strong>Famke Janssen</strong>, was another strong Bond girl after years of weak characters. In fact, EW even voted the villan as <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2007/03/30/countdown-10-best-bond-girls/6">#6 on their list of 10 best Bond girls!</a></li>
		</ul>

	Don't just take our word for it! The guys at Movie Pilot take it a step further, here are their <a href="http://moviepilot.com/posts/3654959">10 Reasons Why Goldeneye is the Best James Bond Film</a>

	<blockquote>GoldenEye was the first film not to use literature from Ian Flemming's novels, instead a unique story was devised by Michael France and took its name from Flemming's estate, GoldenEye, in Jamaica . A lot had changed in the hiatus of the Bond series as this was the first film since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War.

	# The above website does a good job at creating a simple list of points in support of their argument. I don't recognize much of their code, but they use plenty of images of gifs with each bullet point. They use headers and paragraphs for each point, as well as using emphasize for all movie names. They also include links to support some of their points.
