	<li>The above website does a good job at creating a simple list of points in support of their argument. I don't recognize much of their code, but they use plenty of images of gifs with each bullet point. They use headers and paragraphs for each point, as well as using emphasize for all movie names. They also include links to support some of their points.</li>
